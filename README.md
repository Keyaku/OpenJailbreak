<p>An unofficial Git to bump Joshua Hill's (a.k.a. p0sixninja) OpenJailbreak project.
Website: https://www.openjailbreak.org
Twitter: @OpenJailbreak
IRC: chat.freenode.net, #OpenJailbreak</p>

<p>Adds fixes to minor issues, includes a (Home)brew-friendly installation script (Mac OS X only).</p>

<p>HOW TO INSTALL</p>

<p>1- Pick your workspace folder</p>

<p>2- Do the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/Keyaku/OpenJailbreak.git
cd OpenJailbreak</p>

<p>3- Use the original script provided by DarkMalloc (edited to fix typos):
./autobuild.sh
OR, if you have Homebrew installed, I highly recommend doing:
./autobuild_brew.sh</p>

<p>Using the Homebrew script makes it more easy to update or uninstall the OpenJailbreak libs
without affecting much of the /usr/local directory and subdirectories.</p>

<p>I shall update the brew script to add the possibility to uninstall all OpenJailbreak libs
at once (in case anything major is broken) and the ability to install/reinstall a specific OpenJailbreak lib.</p>
