<p>An unofficial Git to bump Joshua Hill's (a.k.a. p0sixninja) OpenJailbreak project.<br>
Website: https://www.openjailbreak.org<br>
Twitter: @OpenJailbreak<br>
IRC: chat.freenode.net, #OpenJailbreak</p>

<p>Adds fixes to minor issues, includes a (Home)brew-friendly installation script (Mac OS X only).</p>

<h1>HOW TO INSTALL</h1>

<p>1- Pick your workspace folder</p>

<p>2- Do the following commands:<br>
git clone https://github.com/Keyaku/OpenJailbreak.git<br>
cd OpenJailbreak</p>

<p>3- I highly recommend now doing:<br>
./autobrew.sh<br>
Since I'm still making the old script available, you can still use it.</p>

<p>This single command fetches and builds the latest versions of all OpenJailbreak libraries.
Using the Homebrew script makes it more easy to update or uninstall the OpenJailbreak libs
without affecting much of the /usr/local directory and subdirectories.</p>
